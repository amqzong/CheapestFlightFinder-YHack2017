# FairWell
This webapp optimizes the cost efficiency of travel for students, allowing them to find the best deals in JetBlue flights with just one click.

# Motivation
As busy, broke, and inexperienced college students, we often don't have time or don't know where to look for the best flights home for breaks. We wanted to create an application that would solve this problem.

# Description
Users input information about their flight including university, destination, and date of departure. Our server then accesses this information and finds available flights that match the user's preferences. It then displays paths departing from the two airports nearest to the user.

# To Run

Initialize a local virtual environment, then run main.py. Open localhost:[port number]/form.

# Main Files

Name: main.py

Description: Allows users to input information on their university or departing location, destination, and which day
they are planning to leave. If the university is inputted, it finds the closest airports to that university.
The webapp employs flexible flight planning by looking at the best flights/deals during the week of the input date and 
outputting the available flights sorted by most money saved.

# Future Work
We hope to implement the Google Maps API to automatically detect the closest airports for college students and expand our service to all college students in the US.
